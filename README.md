# mobile-scss

This repo holds the web mobile styleguide.css file used as a base for all styling happening on web mobile and on parts of the apps, which load webviews.

This currently gets included as a submodule on the shop [here](https://github.com/zalora/shop/tree/master/alice/public/css/local_mobile/mobile-scss)
